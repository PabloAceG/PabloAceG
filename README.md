If you are here, that probably means that you want to know who I am or what I'm 
doing here. Well... I do stuff... and things... Now seriously, I code. If 
anything strikes you, check it out. It's on me.

Anyways, I spent most of my time practicing calisthenics or breaking my computer 
with the latest Arch's updates. I would love to try climbing 🧗‍♂️ and canoeing 
🛶. 

[Reach out to me](mailto:p.aceredag@gmail.com) if you want anything or just... want to talk to me.
